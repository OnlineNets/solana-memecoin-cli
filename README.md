# Code Usage:

## Token:

- src/Token/create.js: create a spl token on devnet or mainnet with a given name, symbol, token image(using irys decentralized storage), supply, decimals, the code by default revokes the mint authority and freeze authority after creating the token.

- src/Token/revoke_authority.js: revoke mint and freeze authority of a given token

## Pool:

- src/Pool/add_pool.js: add liquidity to a pool in a given token address, the code find the most liquid pool (TOKEN_ADDRESS/SOL) in the raydium dex and add liquidity to it. You need to specify the amount of liquidity(sol) you want to add.

- src/Pool/remove_pool.js: remove liquidity from a pool in a given token address, the code find the most liquid pool (TOKEN_ADDRESS/SOL) in the raydium dex and remove liquidity from it. You need to specify the amount of percentage of liquidity you want to remove.

- src/Pool/swap.js: swap token for another token in the raydium dex, src/Trading/dex/raydium/buy.js and src/Trading/dex/raydium/sell.js are based on this code.

- src/Pool/query_pool.js: query the pool information of a given pool address in the raydium dex, it use shyft api to get the pool information. Please make sure you have your shyft api key inside the code before running this code.

- src/Trading/dex/raydium/buy.js: buying spl token using SOL in your wallet using raydium dex swap function

## Helper methods:

- src/helpers/config.js: configuration file for the code.

- src/helpers/util.js: utility functions for the code, including: send transactions to Solana blockchain, dropped transactions handling, etc.

- src/helpers/check_balance.js: check the balance of a given token in your wallet
